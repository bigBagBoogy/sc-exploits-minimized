stateless fuzz test can be run with just the import of Test.sol

for running stateful tests we need to import StdInvariant _and inherit_ it too!

```javascript
import {StdInvariant} from "forge-std/StdInvariant.sol";

contract StateFullFuzzCatchesTest is StdInvariant, Test {}
```
This foundry library holds the methods like: `address[] private _targetedContracts;`
and many more, to nail and narrow down the test params

function `targetContract` will let you tell foundry what contract to do stateful
fuzzing tests on. 

### to do this:
In the setUp function, call the targetContract() and pass in the contract:
```javascript
        targetContract(address(auditContract));
```

Foundry is actually smart enough to read this target contract and go; ok, I can call all the state variables (yes, public variables have functions) and functions in here.
It will call the randomly, with random args.

## in foundry.toml:
[depth = 32] means the anount of things (functions) foundry calls in sequence,
before resetting and starting a new run (think new balloon).

## If you're bugged by errors that are not related to your invariant breaking,
like in the course the arithmetic overflow, you can set:
 `fail_on_revert = false`

The stateFULL test in the course finds the invariant-break, where the
stateLESS test does not, beacause of the sequence tried by foundry:
1. in a particular run it calls: `StatefulFuzzCatches::changeValue(0)` (so args = 0)
2. then it chooses to call `StatefulFuzzCatches::doMoreMathAgain` with this value (0)
making the output of this function 0
